<h1> All About Bearded Dragons! </h1>
<hr />
<h4>The Right Beardie Setup and Care</h4>
<div class="div1">This is the most important area for any new owners of a bearded dragon. Since North American topographies are so different from Australia's, we need to be careful to provide as similar an environment as we can for the comfort of our pets. This includes the correct lighting setup, the correct size of tank, the correct ornaments for the tank, and the correct foods to feed them as well as any supplementary items for their benefit. Items can be easily found at most large pet stores like Petland or Petsmart, it may also be worthwhile to look in to local speciality pet stores for hard-to-find items. Online shopping can cut some of the cost. Signs of illness can include lethargy, weight loss, refusal to eat, prolonged darkening of scales, visual tics, or discharge from the eyes.</div> 
<div class="div2"><h3>What to Feed:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Grasshoppers, crickets and mealworms, dusted with calcium </li>
    <li>Occassionally wax worms, silk worms and hornworms, dusted with calcium</li>
    <li>Earthworms, moths, slugs</li>
    <li>Vegetables (80%-90% of fruit and veggie intake): kale, parsley, cabbage, cilantro, green beans, etc.</li>
