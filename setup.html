<h4>The Right Beardie Setup and Care</h4>
<div class="div1">This is the most important area for any new owners of a bearded dragon. Since North American topographies are so different from Australia's, we need to be careful to provide as similar an environment as we can for the comfort of our pets. This includes the correct lighting setup, the correct size of tank, the correct ornaments for the tank, and the correct foods to feed them as well as any supplementary items for their benefit.</div>
