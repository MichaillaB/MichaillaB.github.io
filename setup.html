<h1> All About Bearded Dragons! </h1>
<hr />
<h4>The Right Beardie Setup and Care</h4>
<div class="div1">We need to be careful to provide as similar an environment as we can for the comfort of our pets. This includes the correct lighting setup, the correct size of tank, the correct ornaments for the tank, and the correct foods to feed them as well as any supplementary items for their benefit. Items can be easily found at most large pet stores like Petland or Petsmart, it may also be worthwhile to look in to local speciality pet stores for hard-to-find items. Online shopping can cut some of the cost. Signs of illness can include lethargy, weight loss, refusal to eat, prolonged darkening of scales, visual tics, or discharge from the eyes. Seek a veterinarian for consultation.</div>

 <div class="bottomright1"><h4>Lighting Guidelines</h4></div>
    <div class="bottomright2"><div class="div3">Bearded dragons need both UVB and UVA light, ensure you have both bulbs. Some bulbs will do both, check the box to make sure. Ensure that the light i 10" above the basking spot. If you purchase a tube light, ensure that it covers only 1/4 of the tank to leave room for a Cool Spot. Day lights should be left on for 10hrs, and a night light can be switched in for Night Time.Additional ceramic heaters or pads can be purchased to make tank hotter if need be. The wattage depends on sixe of tank, larger tanks will need higher wattage. T5 model is recommended. Moniter temperature and humidty before purchase to ensure that the environment is correct. </div></div>
