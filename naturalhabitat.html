<h1> All About Bearded Dragons! </h1>
 <hr />
  <h4>Bearded Dragon Natural Habitat</h4>
<div class="div1">Bearded dragons can be found across much of Australia, although they are most populous in central Australia, in savanna, woodland, and dessert regions. In the wild, bearded dragons will forage for food such as insects or fruits and vegetables. They will bask on rocks when the temperature is right, or burrow when it is too cold.</div>
