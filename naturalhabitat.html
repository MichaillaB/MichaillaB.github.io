<h1> All About Bearded Dragons! </h1>
 <hr />
  <h4>Bearded Dragon Natural Habitat</h4>
<div class="div1">Bearded dragons can be found across much of Australia, although they are most populous in central Australia, in savanna, woodland, and desert regions. In the wild, bearded dragons will forage for food such as insects or fruits and vegetables. Since food is not always plentiful, their stomachs are flexible. They will bask on rocks when the temperature is right, or burrow when it is too cold. Bearded dragons are sexually mature within one to two years, and their mating period is seasonal. Bearded dragons will "wave" their arm to show submission, or "bob" their heads rapidly to show dominance. Their most common predators are dingoes, large birds, and other large lizards.</div>
