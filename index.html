<h4 style="color:#347235;">The Basics of Beardies</h4>
<div class="div1">Many North Americans are interested in bearded dragons, because they are considered unique and exotic reptiles. When one visits a pet store, the bearded dragons appear small and cute, and many children beg their parents or guardians for one of their own. Although parents or guardians tell their children that they must do their own research before they can have one as a pet, these parents and guardians don't always follow up to ensure the information is accurate. Here, we can learn the basics of bearded dragon care, from their natural enviornment to setting up their enclosures at home.</div>
